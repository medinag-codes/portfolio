This is my current Software Engineering Portfolio. It displays projects that I am proud of an has a section for those interested in my work to send me a message.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Template utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

I utilized a free template and manipulated it to my liking, adjusting the colors and design to fit my personality and brand. 

## Optimizations

To ensure that my projects were easily accesible from my portfolio, I added an href to the anchor tags that linked directly to my projects, and opened them in a new tab for a better user experience. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot creating this portfolio, especially how to read and understand someone else's code. I also learned to quickly find parts of code that I am looking for by utilizing the search feature in VS code. This allowed me to quickly locate the parts of code I wanted to change.
